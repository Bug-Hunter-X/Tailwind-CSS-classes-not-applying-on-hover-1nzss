# Tailwind CSS Hover Issue\n\nThis repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes don't seem to apply correctly on hover. The expected behavior is for the background color to change to blue on hover and the text to turn white. However, in the current implementation, this doesn't happen.  The solution involves ensuring that the correct Tailwind directives are used and that there are no conflicting styles.
